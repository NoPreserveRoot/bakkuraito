# Bakkuraito (バックライト)
Bakkuraito is a small backlight control tool I whipped up because using `xbacklight` on Wayland felt janky and I was curious what it would be like to interact with backlights programmatically on Linux (spoiler, it's pretty straightforward). Bakkuraito controls the backlight using pseudofiles available in `/sys/class/backlight/`.

I just thought the name sounded cool. There's probably a better way to translate it, but I don't really speak much Japanese.
